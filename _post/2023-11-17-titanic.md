## What was the Titanic

The Titanic was a famous British ship that was thought to be unsinkable. Unfortunately, it sank after hitting an
iceberg, in the Atlantic leading to the tragic loss of over 1,500 lives in a single night. This blog post will explore 
the impact of this incident and look into information about the Titanic using a list of all passengers on board.

## The Data

We have data about all the passengers, including their names, fares, classes, and whether they survived or died.

Using this data, we tried to answer three questions about the Titanic.

## 1 Who Survived in Each Class and Gender?

During the evacuation of the Titanic, women and children were evacuated first, leaving the men with little chance of 
survival.

The graph shows how many people from each class and gender survived. First-class had the most survivors, 
followed by the third class, and the second class had the fewest survivors. Even though women generally survived more, 
it's interesting to see that the second class had fewer survivors than the third class.

## 2 How Much Did Each Class Cost on Average?
The Titanic was a luxurious ship. When the ship crashed the 1912 money had much higher value compared to todays value.

The graph shows the average prices for the three classes: third class below 20, second class around 22, and first class 
around 85 or so, making it the most expensive. This tells us that a lot of wealthy people were on that ship considering 
the ship was full including the first class.

## 3 How Old Were People on board on Average?

Out of 891 passengers in our data, we calculated the average age by the gender of the passengers. This helps us 
understand the age groups of people on board and suggests that they had enough money to afford a ticket on the luxurious  
and expensive ship.

## Conclusion

The Titanic tragedy, where over 1,500 people had lost their lives, gives us insights into the interests of people back then and shows the economic differences of that time. It's a glimpse into history that also tells us about society during that period in time.
