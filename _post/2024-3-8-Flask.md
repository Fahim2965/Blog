## Intro

Our class has recently been utilizing Flask, a new web framework written in Python. I have found it to be highly beneficial as it allows us to create active web applications more efficiently. Flask essentially serves as a catalyst that simplifies the process of working with Python. It only requires one Python file to be modified to make changes to any other files connected to it which in essence makes the process of making a web application or any other sort of application so much easier than other traditional methods.

## How is it different from HTML and CSS

Flask is a web framework that allows us developers to create and host web applications on a server instead of running them on our local machine. This not only simplifies the development process but also offers additional parts, such as the ability to seat seamless relations between the primary Python file and the templates through specific calls. Flask provides an easy-to-use web server that can handle multiple requests at the same time, making it an excellent choice for building flexible web applications.

## What additional technologies/languages does it use?
		

When using Flask, we can also use the power of the Jinja files, which is a new type of file that we learned about that combines HTML with Python commands. The Jinja files allow us to use basic HTML commands like loops, functions, and conditional statements, which can be very useful when creating dynamic web pages. This is especially useful since Python is not typically used for creating the front end of websites. With Jinja files, we can create web pages that are both dynamic and visually appealing.

## Resources
		
The primary resources I used throughout the learning process were:
Mr. Forlenza, The Flask documentation, and W3Schools (sometimes but didn't help much at least for me).
		
Out of all the resources I used to learn Flask, I found the Flask documentation to be the most helpful. By visiting the website, I was able to gain a thorough understanding of Flask's capabilities, commands, and primary uses. Whenever I encountered an issue, such as not knowing what to input for a specific function or encountering a simple error, the documentation was a great resource to refer to.

## Challenges & Learnings

During the process of learning the Flask application, I encountered many challenges. One of the most common issues I faced was merging the databases. I often made mistakes in my SQL code while attempting to send and receive information from my Jinja files. Although SQL can be relatively easy to use, I was not very familiar with it at the time.

I didnt take take screeshots of any of the issues I had because I didn't know we needed them but yeah.
