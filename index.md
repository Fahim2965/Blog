Hi, my name is Fahim, and I am a Full Stack student.

I am starting my adventure into the tech world and hope to achieve many great things. I am currently a student at The Brooklyn STEAM Center, and George Westinghouse High School. I am currently 15 years old, and I am the youngest of three. I was born in Noakhali, Bangladesh, and lived there for 9 years. I moved to Brooklyn in 2015.

Some of my interests are playing soccer in my free time. My favorite soccer teams are FC Barcelona, PSG, Liverpool, and Manchester City.
My favorite players are Lionel Messi, Christnio Ronaldo, Levendoski, Naymer Jr, and Dybala. I also like playing video games such as Call of Duty and League of Legends, even though I am not that good at them I still like to think of myself as the best player. Another interest of mine is watching anime. I love anime, especially action anime.
