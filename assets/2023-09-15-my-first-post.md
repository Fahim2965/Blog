During my apprenticeship with WorkED, I was able to learn and experience many different careers. Some of my most memorable experiences were when we visited Arlenee Lopez at Summit Trail Advisors. What I loved most about the visit was being able to see how a big company like Summit Trail manage their client data and how they secure that data. That was a very unique and immersive experience and I enjoyed every part of it.

Throughout the program there were many things we learned about such as OSINT, Python, and many more. But my favorite topic was when we learned Python because I have done Python before so I found that very interesting and easy for me to understand. Also because when we were doing the Python project I saw that more people were interacting with each other than the other projects and that's another reason why the Python topic was my favorite topic that we covered. 

My favorite experience throughout the whole apprenticeship was as I mentioned before was when we visited Arlenee Lopez at her company Summit Trail Advisors. That for me was my favorite experience because we were able to see what a professional workplace was like and how they operate. Also because we were able to see how a major company such as Summit Trail Advisors secure their data and their clients data.
